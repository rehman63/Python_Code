Random Name Generator

Explanation:

Import random: Imports the random module for random number generation.
Define generate_random_name: Defines a function to generate random names.
Create Name Lists: Creates two lists, first_names and last_names, containing common names.
Generate Names: Iterates over the desired number of names:
Selects a random first name and last name from the respective lists.
Concatenates the first and last names to form a full name.
Appends the full name to the names list.
Return Names: Returns the list of generated names.
Customization:

More Names: Add more names to the first_names and last_names lists.
Different Name Patterns: Modify the name generation logic to create different name patterns (e.g., middle names, nicknames).
Language-Specific Names: Use language-specific name lists to generate names from different cultures.
Weighted Randomness: Assign weights to names to influence the probability of their selection.
By customizing these aspects, you can tailor the random name generator to your specific needs.
