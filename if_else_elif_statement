# Simple Python program using if, elif, and else

def check_number():
    number = float(input("Enter a number: "))

    if number > 0:
        print("The number is positive.")
    elif number < 0:
        print("The number is negative.")

# Call the function
check_number()


"""
Explanation:
The program asks the user to input a number.
It uses if to check if the number is positive.
If the first condition is false, it checks if the number is negative using elif.
If neither condition is true, it prints that the number is zero using else.
